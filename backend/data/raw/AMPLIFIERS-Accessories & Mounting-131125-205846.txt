T-slot mounting

The chassis of the Utility Amplifiers (ARC/NARC) have integrated T-slots that conform to the 20-series industry standard.

These slots allow the installation of T-nuts and various other fasteners and accessories that are compatible with the 20-series system. This creates a very versatile system for mounting the amplifier or for attaching accessories.
