ARC-NARC I/O Truth Tab
An audio amplifier "Truth Table" is a logical table that maps different input states or conditions to corresponding output states or settings. In the context of an ARC-NARC this refers to how various inputs (such as volume level, input source selection, tone control settings, etc.) correspond to specific outputs (such as speaker output levels, signal processing states, or LED indicators).

ARC ensures seamless communication between devices, allowing for precise mapping of input states to output settings.

The Truth Tables are structured into sections based on different scenarios involving Default and Secondary Sources, Switchover Behavior, Amp Configuration, Auto-ON settings, and Output Behavior. Each scenario outlines how specific input conditions, such as volume levels, source selection, and tone control settings, correspond to output states like speaker output levels and signal processing states. By breaking down these scenarios systematically, the Truth Tables provide a comprehensive guide for configuring audio amplifiers in various setups, ensuring optimal performance and functionality.

Control Documents
In order to share a single-source of truth for these truth tables with Hansong, these truth tables were exported to word documents, and stored on sharepoint with the following links:
1. Ducking mode truth table: ARC-NARC+I+O+Truth+Table.doc
2. Mute mode truth table: ARC-NARC+I+O+Truth+Table_MUTE.doc

Switching Behaviors
- Anytime a TV/CEC/ARC session is active, the HDMI input is treated as if it has active audio.
- "X" means don't care (could be any configuration and would not change the outcome)
- "Ducking" means to attenuate the default source by the (ducking attenuation setting, typically -20dB), thereby allowing the secondary source to be heard clearly. The secondary source is not attenuated.

Conditions
Settings
| HDMI | Analog | Auto-ON Mode | Switchover Behavior |
|------|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| X    | X      | Always ON     | X                   |
| ON   | X      | X             | X                   |
| X    | X      | Auto-Sense    | X                   |
| Standby | No Audio | No Audio | No Output |

Output Expected Behavior
| Initial Power State | Source Conditions | Audio Output | Power State |
|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|-------------|
| Default             | Secondary         | X Duck ON    | Audio Present | Audio Present |
| Output is a mix of both inputs: |
| - HDMI audio attenuated by fixed amount (ducking attenuation setting, typically -20dB) |
| - Analog audio at unattenuated level |
| Both signals can be heard, but HDMI signal is quieter (ducked) so Analog signal can be heard more easily |
| System remains ON |

Default      Secondary  X  Duck  ON  Audio Present  – No Audio (No CEC command)  No Audio  
Initial and final Output is only HDMI audio because there is no Analog audio:  
• HDMI audio at unattenuated level  
• No Analog audio contribution  
When the HDMI audio drops out, the amplifier output becomes inaudible. It is still outputting the HDMI source because the TV/CEC/eARC session is still active, but the HDMI audio is too quiet to be heard.  
System remains ON because the TV is still ON and CEC standby command was not received  

Default      Secondary  X  Duck  ON  Audio Present  – MUTE CEC command  No Audio  
Initial output is only HDMI audio because there is no Analog audio:  
• HDMI audio at unattenuated level  
• No Analog audio contribution  
After the Mute CEC command:  
• HDMI audio (but it is muted)  
• No Analog audio contribution  
The HDMI source is muted but still active because the TV/CEC/eARC session is still active. The amplifier output is inaudible because there the HDMI source is muted.  
System remains ON because the TV is still ON and CEC standby command was not received  

Default      Secondary  X  Duck  ON  Audio Present  – No Audio  Audio Present  
Initial output:  
• HDMI audio attenuated by fixed amount [ducking attenuation setting, typically -20dB]  
• Analog audio at unattenuated level  
After Analog audio drops out and [source switchover timeout], output becomes:  
• HDMI audio at unattenuated level  
• No Analog audio contribution  
System remains ON  

Default      Secondary  X  Duck  ON  Audio Present  – MUTE  Audio Present  
Output continues to be a mix of both inputs:  
• HDMI audio attenuated by [ducking attenuation setting, typically -20dB]  
• Analog audio at unattenuated level  
Only Analog audio is heard on the output because HDMI audio is silent (but the TV/CEC/eARC session is still active)  
System remains ON  

Default      Secondary  X  Duck  ON  Audio Present  – MUTE  Audio Present

NARC Ducking

• Presence of SPDIF carrier does not mean that audio is present, but presence of SPDIF carrier will prevent system from going into low-power standby.
• “X” means don’t care (could be any configuration and would not change the outcome)
• “Ducking” means to attenuate the default source by the [ducking attenuation setting, typically ~20dB], thereby allowing the secondary source to be heard clearly. The secondary source is not attenuated.

• Anytime a TV/CEC/eARC session is active, the HDMI input is treated as if it has active audio.
• "X" means don't care (could be any configuration and would not change the outcome)
• "Mute" means to attenuate the default source by an infinite amount of dB, thereby allowing the secondary source to be heard clearly. The secondary source is not attenuated.

• No contribution from HDMI because it is muted (due to IR command)
After the Power IR command:
• HDMI audio at unattenuated level
No Output
System remains in standby mode

Secondary	Default	Auto-Sense	Mute	ON	Audio Present	X	Power ON / No IR COMMAND
Initial output:
• No contribution from Analog
• HDMI audio output Only
System remains ON (no behavior change)

Secondary	Default	Auto-Sense	Mute	OFF (from IR command)	X	Audio Present	Power OFF / No IR Command
Output is only Analog input source:
• No HDMI audio contribution since IR turned off digital input
• Analog audio contribution
System remains ON (no behavior change)

Secondary	Default	Auto-Sense	Mute	ON	Audio Present → TV powered off/CEC session ends	Audio Present	Power ON / No IR COMMAND
Output is only HDMI input source:
• No HDMI audio contribution
• No Analog audio contribution
• Output remains HDMI after IR command because CEC is disabled.
