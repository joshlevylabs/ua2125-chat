Line Output DSP Behavior - UA2-125

## Overview
The Line Output (Analog RCA outputs) on the UA2-125 amplifier is essentially a passthrough with selective DSP processing applied.

## DSP Features Applied to Line Output

The Line Output receives the following DSP processing:

1. **Volume Tracking**
   - The line output volume follows the main amplifier volume control
   - Can be enabled/disabled in SonArc app settings
   - Allows synchronized volume control for external subwoofers or additional amplifiers

2. **LPF/Infrasonic Filters**
   - Low-pass filtering (when configured)
   - Infrasonic filtering to protect speakers from subsonic frequencies
   - Configurable in SonArc app

3. **Phase Shifts**
   - Phase adjustment/inversion if configured
   - Used for speaker alignment and subwoofer integration

4. **Delay Shifts**
   - Time delay/alignment if configured
   - Helps synchronize audio across multiple zones or speakers

## Important: Amplifier EQ NOT Applied

**Critical Note:** The Amplifier EQ (speaker equalization curves) is NOT applied to the Line Output.

- The Line Output provides a "clean" signal with only the DSP features listed above
- Speaker-specific EQ tuning (bass boost, treble adjustment, room correction) only affects the main amplifier outputs
- This ensures the line output can be used with external amplifiers that have their own EQ or with subwoofers that need full-range signal

## Use Cases

The Line Output is designed for:

1. **Subwoofer Connection**
   - Connect to powered subwoofer
   - Volume tracking ensures subwoofer follows main volume
   - LPF can be applied to create a proper subwoofer feed

2. **External Amplifier**
   - Drive additional zones or speakers
   - Clean signal allows external amplifier to apply its own processing
   - Phase and delay allow proper integration with main speakers

3. **Recording/Monitoring**
   - Clean output for recording purposes
   - No speaker-specific coloration from amplifier EQ

## Configuration in SonArc App

To configure Line Output behavior:
1. Open SonArc app
2. Navigate to Outputs settings
3. Enable/disable Volume Tracking
4. Configure LPF frequency (if using subwoofer)
5. Set phase and delay as needed for your setup

## Technical Specifications

- **Output Type:** Analog RCA
- **Output Level:** Line level (2V typical)
- **Impedance:** 10kΩ (suitable for line-level inputs)
- **Volume Tracking:** Configurable (0 to -80dB following main volume)

## Summary

The Line Output = Passthrough + Selective DSP (volume tracking, filters, phase, delay) - Amplifier EQ

This design provides flexibility for system integration while maintaining signal integrity for downstream processing.
